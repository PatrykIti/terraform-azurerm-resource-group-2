<h1 align="center">Terraform module for managing Azure Resource Groups (2 approach)</h1>

<p>This is the second approach to this module and the module itself is a little more complext then in first approach but entire configuration is on the side of module execution. So your TFVARS will have less variables</p>

<p>All modules were tested on my private Azure subscription before merged here, so if you encountered some problems than please check twice your configuration ☺️ </p>

<p>You can look into another repository for <a href ="https://github.com/PatrykIti/terraform-azurerm-resource-group-1">terraform-azurerm-resource-group-1</a> module with different approach than it is here.</p>

<p>Another respository to look into is about <a href = "https://github.com/PatrykIti/terraform-environment-configurations/tree/main/azurerm-resource-group-2">executing module via Azure Pipelines within environment configuration</a>, together with backend configuration etc.</p>

<p>If you want to keep an eye on current changes made to modules than please look into <a href="https://github.com/users/PatrykIti/projects/1">Project section -> Terraform modules for Azure</a></p>
